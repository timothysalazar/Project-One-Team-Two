# Project-One-Team-Two
A collaboration of Seth Carlyon, Gaby Garcia, Graham Jaeger, Kyle Murphy, and Timothy Salazar.

This repository contains analyses of data obtained from the IUCN Red List API, its associated spatial API, and from FishBase.se.
Data cleaning and analysis was done using python and jupyter notebooks.

All these datasets contain information on threatened species. We analyzed the available datasets to detect what biases might exist and to get a sense for how spatial distributions correlate with known endangered species. 

Note: Unfortunately the IUCN API went down partway through our data analyses, returning a 502 error. Because of this our analysis was more limited than we had intended, and certain figures were arrested in their development.
